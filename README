ALPM 3.06

INTRODUCTION

This is a perl XS module which provides an interface to the libalpm C library.
libalpm is used by Archlinux (and other distributions) who use pacman as the
package managing program.

Read-only access is provided to the database. All transaction creation logic
was removed from this module. After each major pacman upgrade, and sub-
sequent libalpm API change, I would be forced to rewrite a majority of this
module. After the third or fourth time I decided it was not worth the effort
for a feature possibly no one uses in an obscure perl module no one knows
about.

If you really need transactions why not call pacman with "system" or
backticks? In contrast, complicated queries becomes ugly and convoluted
when calling pacman in shell scripts. With the aid of this module, queries
should instead be possible in the quintessential ugly and succinct perl form.
Small utility scripts, like the examples, can also be quickly drawn up. This
is the new goal of the module.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the alpm C library that is included with pacman.
libalpm 9.0.0 included with pacman version 4.2.0 was the latest version
used to build and test this module.

DOCUMENTATION

The online documentation is bundled with this module in the form of POD
files under the lib/ directory. To read a document right now you can run
``perldoc lib/ALPM.pod''. These also display formatted in github and are
